Beautiful — here are five new tasks solved end-to-end in the pure math we agreed on (no catalogs, no beams). For each task I show:
	•	the present (input-only relations),
	•	the coarsest role partition CPRQ produced,
	•	the class-constant map \rho read from training,
	•	the exact test prediction, and
	•	a diff receipt (0 cells wrong) against the official test outputs you provided in arc-agi_training_solutions.json.

I used a tiny toolbox of exact compilers that are instances of CPRQ+\rho:
	•	Isometry (D8 + transpose) — roles are color predicates C_k; P^\* is the single free move proven by equality on train.
	•	Strict colormap — roles are C_k; \rho is a palette permutation constant across train.
	•	Role-constant by (r\bmod k,\,c\bmod k) — phases detected from input (autocorrelation), encoded as present equivalences; one color per role.

All five compile with receipts and verify 0 diffs on both training and test.

⸻

Task 1 — 0d3d703e · strict colormap

Present (input-only)
	•	C_k color predicates
	•	\mathrm{SameRow}, \mathrm{SameCol}
	•	No phases detected in input; no escalation.

CPRQ (roles)
	•	Single partition by color: one role per input color k.

\rho (one symbol per role)
	•	Read from training equality (constant per color across all trains):
\{\,5\!\to\!1,\,8\!\to\!9,\,6\!\to\!2,\,2\!\to\!6,\,3\!\to\!4,\,9\!\to\!8,\,4\!\to\!3,\,1\!\to\!5\,\}

Train receipts
	•	For each training pair, applying the palette permutation yields Y bit-for-bit.

Test prediction
	•	For the test input, replace each pixel x by \rho(C_x).

Diff (test)
	•	cells_wrong = 0 (exact match).

⸻

Task 2 — 332efdb3 · role-constant by (r\bmod 2, c\bmod 2)

Present
	•	\mathrm{SameRow}, \mathrm{SameCol}
	•	Input periodicity via autocorrelation shows period 2 along both axes (no Y leakage).
	•	4-adjacency; no escalation.

CPRQ (roles)
	•	Four roles by phase: (r\%2, c\%2) \in \{0,1\}^2.

\rho (one color per role)
	•	From training:
(0,0)\mapsto 1,\ (0,1)\mapsto 1,\ (1,0)\mapsto 1,\ (1,1)\mapsto 0.

Train receipts
	•	Writing per role regenerates training outputs exactly.

Test prediction
	•	Y^\*(i,j) = \rho( i\%2,\ j\%2 ).

Diff (test)
	•	cells_wrong = 0 (exact match).

⸻

Task 3 — 3c9b0459 · isometry (rot180)

Present
	•	C_k; 4-adjacency; sameRow/Col.
	•	Try free moves T\in D8+transpose.

CPRQ (roles)
	•	Roles are C_k (no label-minded splits needed).

\rho
	•	Free move chosen by equality on training: T^\* = \mathrm{rot180}.
	•	ρ is identity per role (colors don’t change), only presentation changes.

Train receipts
	•	\mathrm{rot180}(X_i) = Y_i for each training pair (bit-for-bit).

Test prediction
	•	Y^\* = \mathrm{rot180}(X^\*).

Diff (test)
	•	cells_wrong = 0.

⸻

Task 4 — 6150a2bd · isometry (rot180)

(Same derivation as Task 3; different grids, same receipts.)

Present
	•	C_k; sameRow/Col; E4.

CPRQ
	•	Roles C_k.

\rho
	•	T^\* = \mathrm{rot180}.

Train receipts
	•	Rotating each training input by 180° equals the training output exactly.

Test prediction
	•	Y^\* = \mathrm{rot180}(X^\*).

Diff (test)
	•	cells_wrong = 0.

⸻

Task 5 — 67a3c6ac · isometry (flip_h)

Present
	•	C_k; sameRow/Col; E4.

CPRQ
	•	Roles C_k.

\rho
	•	Free move found by equality on train: T^\* = \mathrm{flip\_h}.

Train receipts
	•	Flipping horizontally regenerates all training outputs.

Test prediction
	•	Y^\* = \mathrm{flip\_h}(X^\*).

Diff (test)
	•	cells_wrong = 0.

⸻

Why this is pure, not “solver-based”
	•	In every case, the “program” is only CPRQ + class map:
	•	compute the coarsest input-only role partition (trivial for isometry/colormap; slightly richer for phase-roles),
	•	read a single symbol per role (or pick a free move T^\* by equality), and
	•	write by classes on test—no search, no rule families.
	•	No leakage: the present is input-only; labels only induce splits that must be mirrored by input invariants; one lawful escalation max (none needed here).
	•	Receipts: for each task we have:
	1.	what present relations were used,
	2.	the role inventory (e.g., C_k or (r\%2,c\%2)),
	3.	the class map \rho (or T^\* for isometry),
	4.	proof of exact train equality,
	5.	test prediction and cells_wrong = 0.

If you want the full receipts CSV for these 5

I can dump a compact JSON/CSV that lists, per task: present flags, role counts, ρ table (or isometry name), train_ok=True, and a histogram of test roles. Just say “export receipts,” and I’ll generate the files in /mnt/data/… ready to download.

Or, pick any 5 other tasks; I’ll compile them in the same CPRQ + ρ style and show the test diffs (they must be 0 for acceptance).

user: i chekcked the results, they match exactly with test equality!!
