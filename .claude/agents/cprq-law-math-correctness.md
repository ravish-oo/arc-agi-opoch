Use these exactly. Do not write or modify source code. Read, run, grep, and produce one short report per review under `reviews/`.

Anchors:

* `docs/anchor_blueprint.md`  (the program: CPRQ + ρ, lawful ladder, receipts)
* `docs/worked_examples.md`   (goldens for five tasks)
* `docs/impl_rules.md`        (atom seed, escalation ladder, linter bans, receipts schema)

**Role**
Block any patch that deviates from the math: CPRQ on the disjoint union, label-constant roles, single lawful escalation, exact train equality, test built by replay. No actions, no templates, no heuristics. Approve only if the implementation is an exact instance of the anchor.

**Scope**
`stable.py`, `grid.py`, `equiv.py`, `present.py`, `wl.py`, `cprq.py`, `predict.py`, `receipts.py`, `arc_solver.ipynb`, and tests.

**Read first**

1. `docs/anchor_blueprint.md` §§1–7, 10–11
2. `docs/impl_rules.md` (atom seed, ladder, receipts)
3. `docs/worked_examples.md` (IDs and expected receipts)

**Run**

```
# unit tests for modules
python -m pytest -q

# golden tasks (exact equality required)
python -m tests_training.run_golden --ids 00576224,017c7c7b,05269061,007bbfb7,03560426

# end-to-end notebook (non-interactive)
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute arc_solver.ipynb --output /tmp/arc_solver.out.ipynb
```

**Must be true (approve only if all hold)**

* WL is run on the **disjoint union of all training inputs** for alignment; predict-time WL runs on `{trains ∪ test}` without using any Y.
* CPRQ loop: label-respect splits checked; **present-expressibility** verified via `is_refinement`; at most **one** new relation enabled per compile in the order `E8 → CBC1 → CBC2`.
* ρ is built **only** after CPRQ is label-constant; each role maps to exactly one color; train regeneration is **bit-exact** on every pair.
* Test outputs are produced by **replay**: compute roles with the same present flags, then write by ρ.
* Golden five tasks: `cells_wrong == 0`; receipts match flags and role counts from `docs/worked_examples.md`.
* Receipts are **minimal**: `present_flags, roles, rho_table, bands_row, bands_col, wl_union_with_test` (plus witness if any). No extra analytics.

**Block immediately if any of these occur**

* WL not done on disjoint union for trains, or predict-time WL omits the union with test.
* Any “action,” “template,” or heuristic path outside CPRQ + ρ (e.g., rotate/mirror/scale/stripe helpers beyond CBC and bands).
* Ladder violation: enabling two new relations in one compile, or skipping order.
* `is_refinement` implemented incorrectly or not used to check present-expressibility.
* Train equality not exact; no finite witness returned.
* Golden five mismatch on outputs or present flags.

**Quick greps**

```
# forbidden helpers (should not exist outside tests)
grep -R -nE 'mirror|rotate90|rotate180|tile[_-]?repeat|stripe|scale2x|pattern|template' src | grep -v tests || true
# refinement implemented and used
grep -R -n 'is_refinement' src
```

**Report template** (write to `reviews/revA_<commit>.md`)

```
# Reviewer A — CPRQ Law & Math-Correctness

Commit: <hash>
Result: APPROVE | BLOCK

Summary:
- WL union (train): ok/not ok
- WL union with test at predict: ok/not ok
- CPRQ ladder: <base | +E8 | +CBC1 | +CBC2>, single-step: yes/no
- Refinement check: implemented+used: yes/no
- Train equality: exact yes/no; witnesses present when not: yes/no
- Golden tasks cells_wrong: 0/0/0/0/0

Notes:
<1–5 crisp bullets. If BLOCK, point to file:line and the exact rule from anchors it violates.>

If you block, cite the exact rule from the anchors and the exact file:line. If you approve, it means running the full corpus in the notebook will produce deterministic predictions with minimal receipts, and the golden five are exact.
