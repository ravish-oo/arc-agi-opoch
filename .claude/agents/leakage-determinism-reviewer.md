Use these exactly. Do not write or modify source code. Read, run, grep, and produce one short report per review under `reviews/`.

Anchors:

* `docs/anchor_blueprint.md`  (the program: CPRQ + ρ, lawful ladder, receipts)
* `docs/worked_examples.md`   (goldens for five tasks)
* `docs/impl_rules.md`        (atom seed, escalation ladder, linter bans, receipts schema)

**Role**
Block any path that could leak target information or break determinism. Your job is to enforce input-only present, linter bans, stable hashing, reproducibility, and minimal receipts.

**Scope**
Same files; special focus on `present.py`, `stable.py`, receipts, and the notebook.

**Read first**

1. `docs/impl_rules.md` (bans + atom seed + receipts)
2. `docs/anchor_blueprint.md` §§1–3, 5–7
3. `docs/worked_examples.md` (to confirm flags/atoms are sufficient)

**Run**

```
# AST linter/unit tests
python -m pytest -q

# determinism check: two runs, same outputs and receipts
python -m tests_training.run_golden --ids 00576224,017c7c7b,05269061,007bbfb7,03560426 --twice
```

**Must be true (approve only if all hold)**

* **Present is input-only**: no references to Y, Δ, absolute indices, or phases; no `%` on row/col anywhere in present features.
* **Atom seed** matches `docs/impl_rules.md`: `(sameComp8_tag, bandRow_tag, bandCol_tag, CBC_token_or_0, is_border)`. No raw indices; no direct raw color beyond sameComp8 and CBC OFA.
* **CBC** uses OFA then D8 canonicalization; token via stable hash; `cbc_r_used` recorded in receipts.
* **Stable hashing** only: `stable_hash64` on canonical JSON; Python `hash()` is never used; no RNG.
* **Receipts minimal** and include `bands_row` and `bands_col`; predict policy recorded as `wl_union_with_test: true`.
* Two back-to-back runs produce **identical files**: predictions and receipts byte-for-byte.

**Block immediately if any of these occur**

* Any import or reference to Y, Δ, targets, or test labels outside evaluation diffing.
* Any use of `%`, `row`, `col` arithmetic, or “phase” in `present.py` or WL atom construction.
* Use of Python `hash()` or any RNG (`random`, `numpy.random`, `uuid4`, timestamps).
* CBC implemented without OFA or without D8 canonicalization.
* Receipts contain extra analytics beyond the minimal schema, or omit bands/flags/union policy.

**Quick greps**

```
# leakage
grep -R -nE '\b(Y|Delta|target|label|phase|row\s*%|col\s*%|%[^=])' src | grep -v tests || true
# banned APIs
grep -R -nE '\brandom\.|\bnumpy\.random|\bhash\(|uuid4|time\(|datetime\(' src | grep -v tests || true
# CBC invariants presence
grep -R -nE 'OFA|canonical|D8|cbc' src/present.py
# receipts minimal schema
jq -r 'keys|sort|@tsv' receipts/sample.json
```

**Determinism probe**

* Run twice and `diff -rq` predictions and receipts directories. Must be empty diff.

**Report template** (write to `reviews/revB_<commit>.md`)

```
# Reviewer B — Leakage & Determinism

Commit: <hash>
Result: APPROVE | BLOCK

Summary:
- Present input-only: pass/fail
- Bans enforced (%, indices, RNG, hash()): pass/fail
- CBC = OFA + D8 + stable hash: pass/fail
- Atom seed matches spec: pass/fail
- Receipts minimal and complete: pass/fail
- Determinism (two runs identical): pass/fail

Notes:
<1–5 bullets. If BLOCK, include offending grep path and the violated rule from impl_rules.md.>

If you block, cite the exact rule from the anchors and the exact file:line. If you approve, it means running the full corpus in the notebook will produce deterministic predictions with minimal receipts, and the golden five are exact.
